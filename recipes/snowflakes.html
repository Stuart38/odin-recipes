    <p>Gingerbread Snowflakes â€“ No Cutter, No Problem</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Making Christmas cookies with my mom and aunts is one of my oldest and
      fondest memories. Every year around this time, I think back to that floury
      kitchen table, where the dough was rolled, and punched out with the
      classic array of holiday cookie cutters. The Santa shape was my favorite,
      since that one made the biggest cookie, but I also liked the stars. If
      I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times; people love pointy food.

      So, as I started this production, I couldn't help but wish I'd inherited
      those old dinged up cutters, since I had nothing with which to make the
      desired snowflake shape. I know I could've easily ordered one, but
      thinking of all those other cutter-less kitchens out there, I decided to
      figure out a way to get the same shape without one, and this is what I
      came up with.

      Positioning the pieces of dough does take a few minutes, but at the end of
      the day, this method isn't any more time consuming than the classic
      method. Plus, since every snowflake is supposed to be different, the
      slight variations it produces really works. By the way, if you're not into
      the best gingerbread cookie ever, this technique would work with any
      cookie dough stiff enough to shape. Either way, I hope you give these
      snowflake cookies a try soon. Enjoy!
