    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my family's favorite Christmas dinner. Elegant for dinner parties
      or a romantic dinner for two. If you desire crabmeat instead of lobster,
      go for it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (8 ounce) filet mignon (beef tinderloin)</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon OLD BAY &reg; Seasoning</li>
      <li>8 ounces lobster tail, cleaned and chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set oven to Broil at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle tenderloins all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap
        each filet with bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Place on a broiling
        pan, and broil to desired doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes per side for
        medium rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        While tenderloins are cooking, melt 1/4 cup of butter over medium heat
        with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay® seasoning. Stir in chopped lobster meat, and
        cook until done. Spoon lobster meat over cooked tenderloins, and return
        them to the broiler until the lobster meat begins to brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the lobster is in the oven, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of butter
        in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, cook until it browns, turning
        the color of a hazelnut. To serve, spoon the browned butter over the
        steaks, and sprinkle with the remaining Old Bay® seasoning.
      </li>
    </ol>
