    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gingerbread Snowflakes â€“ No Cutter, No Problem</p>

    <p>
      Making Christmas cookies with my mom and aunts is one of my oldest and
      fondest memories. Every year around this time, I think back to that floury
      kitchen table, where the dough was rolled, and punched out with the
      classic array of holiday cookie cutters. The Santa shape was my favorite,
      since that one made the biggest cookie, but I also liked the stars. If
      I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times; people love pointy food.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, as I started this production, I couldn't help but wish I'd inherited
      those old dinged up cutters, since I had nothing with which to make the
      desired snowflake shape. I know I could've easily ordered one, but
      thinking of all those other cutter-less kitchens out there, I decided to
      figure out a way to get the same shape without one, and this is what I
      came up with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Positioning the pieces of dough does take a few minutes, but at the end of
      the day, this method isn't any more time consuming than the classic
      method. Plus, since every snowflake is supposed to be different, the
      slight variations it produces really works. By the way, if you're not into
      the best gingerbread cookie ever, this technique would work with any
      cookie dough stiff enough to shape. Either way, I hope you give these
      snowflake cookies a try soon. Enjoy!

      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>&frac18; teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>&frac18; teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>&frac23; cup white sugar</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup molasses</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Icing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong>
        <p>
          Whisk 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, cocoa powder, ground ginger,
          cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, black pepper, and cayenne
          together in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>
        <p>
          Cream together butter and sugar in a separate bowl with an electric
          mixer until pale yellow and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add molasses,
          vanilla, and egg. Whisk mixture until well blended. Add flour mixture
          to butter mixture and stir just until the flour disappears. Spread out
          a piece of plastic wrap on the counter and set dough on top. Wrap
          dough with plastic wrap while shaping it into a rectangle
          approximately 1-inch high by 4 to 5 inches wide. Refrigerate until
          dough is cold and firm, about 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
          with a Silpat mat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>
        <p>
          After the dough has chilled, slice across the block into 14 or 15
          pieces about 3/8 inch thick. Each slice is then cut in half, and each
          half into 3 strips lengthwise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>
        <p>
          Use 3 strips of the dough to form the 6-pointed star as shown and
          place onto the prepared baking sheet with space in between as they
          spread out.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven for about 12 minutes if you like the
          cookies to be chewy, or 15 minutes for crispy cookies. Remove from the
          oven and wait for 5 minutes before carefully transferring cookies to a
          wire rack. Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong>
        <p>
          Mix together the powdered sugar and water until a ribbon is formed.
          Transfer the icing into a piping bag with a small round tip. Pipe
          snowflake designs onto the cooled cookies.
